Building a 360-degree AI-powered car analysis app where users can upload or take a picture of a car to get detailed insights.

Phase 1: AI-Powered Car Identification
Use Googleâ€™s Gemini LLM (initially free, later paid) to analyze images and provide details like make, model, year, color, and other specifications.
Phase 2: Integration with Excise Database
Connect with excise records to fetch ownership details, registration history, and legal status.
Phase 3: Mechanic & Fault Detection System
Partner with mechanics and diagnostic tools to analyze potential faults, service history, and repair estimates based on AI and image recognition.
The goal is to create a comprehensive, AI-driven car insights platform that evolves from basic identification to full-fledged ownership and maintenance tracking.
